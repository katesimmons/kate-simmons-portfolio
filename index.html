<div class="introduction">
<p>I do STRATEGY. Iâ€™m most interested in the intersection between business offering and customer/user need. Everything drives from the way the end user experiences that connection point.

I do USER EXPERIENCE in the broadest sense, all inputs and outputs. Definition of objectives, content strategy, interaction design, page layout, the works. 

I do INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE in the traditional sense. I organize groups of data and data sources and make them talk to each other.

I do PROCESS ANALYSIS. I fix broken things, from internal project processes to external systems analysis.

I do MANAGEMENT. I mentor individuals and lead project teams.</p>
